# Cat Critter Playground

A single-page, cat-friendly playground where colorful bugs, flies, lizards, and mice scurry around the screen. Cats can tap or swipe at them to make them pop away.

## Running locally

No build tools required. Serve the static files with any HTTP server (or open `index.html` directly).

```bash
# from the repo root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser or tablet
```

## Controls

- **Add more critters** – instantly drop a handful of critters.
- **Auto-spawn toggle** – keeps a steady stream of new critters.
- **Reset** – clear the field and score.
- Tap, click, or swipe across the play field to splat critters and keep curious paws engaged.
